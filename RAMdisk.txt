These commands create a RAM disk on a Linux system:

1: Create a directory that will serve as the mount point for the RAM disk.
• sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ramdisk

2: Open the system’s filesystem table for editing.
• sudo nano /etc/fstab

3: Add the line (configures a temporary filesystem (tmpfs) mounted at /mnt/ramdisk)
• tmpfs   /mnt/ramdisk   tmpfs   size=1M,mode=1777   0   0

It allocates 1 MB of RAM for storage and sets permissions so all users can read, write, and execute within it.
